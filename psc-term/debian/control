Description: Collection of well-known terminal applications
 This metapackage provides nothing itself, but depends on lots of packages
 that the maintainer uses regularly in terminal windows.  These are ones
 that use the full window space, probably using ncurses.
 .
   * default-mta or msmtp-mta - for mutt
   * hexer - to edit binary files
   * hnb - an outlining note taker
   * htop - tolerable browsing of processes
   * mutt - least-suckiest mail client
   * ncdu - to see what is taking up all the space
   * ncmpcpp - for managing playback on MPD servers
   * screen - to multiplex and detach terminals
   * tig - to browse git history
   * w3m - HTML renderer and web client
   * wyrd - frontend to remind calendars
 .
