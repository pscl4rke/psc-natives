Description: Collection of well-known terminal applications
 This package provides nothing itself, but depends on lots of packages
 that the maintainer uses regularly in terminal windows.  These are ones
 that use the full window space, probably using ncurses.
 .
   * htop - tolerable browsing of processes
   * default-mta or msmtp-mta - for mutt
   * mutt - least-suckiest mail client
   * ncdu - to see what is taking up all the space
   * ncmpcpp - for managing playback on MPD servers
   * screen - to multiplex and detach terminals
   * tig - to browse git history
   * w3m - HTML renderer and web client
 .
 Their documentation is also included.
