Description: Collection of tools for using Sword Bible data
 This metapackage provides nothing itself, but depends on lots of packages
 that the maintainer uses for working with Sword data from CrossWire's
 Bible project.  It assumes that the data files will be provided separately
 to satisfy copyright holders.  The packages are:
 .
   * diatheke - Command-line tool for reading files
   * libsword-dev - Compilation headers to build my own software
   * libsword-utils - Assorted tools for working with the data
   * xiphos - Gtk application for reading files
 .
 Their documentation is also included.
