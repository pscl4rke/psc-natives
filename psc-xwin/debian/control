Description: Collection of toolkit-independent GUI tools
 This package provides nothing itself, but depends upon packages
 that the maintainer considers important for working in X windows
 environment.  The idea is that they won't have a dependency on
 a particular toolkit, although there will be some usage of GTK,
 mostly courtesy of package recommendations.
