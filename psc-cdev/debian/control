Description: Collection of well-used C development programs
 This metapackage provides nothing itself, but depends on lots of packages
 that the maintainer uses for C development.  They are:
 .
   * exuberant-ctags - for improved IDE experience
   * gcc & g++ - compilers for C and C++ code
   * indent - reformat code to match standards
   * libc-dev - the GNU C library
   * make - the most common build tool
   * valgrind - detect some kinds of programmer error
 .
 Their documentation is also included.
