Description: Collecton of packages for Python 3 development
 This metapackage provides nothing itself, but depends on lots of
 packages that the maintainer uses when working in Python.
 .
   * python3 - an actual interpreter
   * python3-dev - to use wrapped C libraries
   * python3-pip - to acquire libraries
   * python3-venv - allow `ensure-pip` to work
   * python3-virtualenv - isolate dependencies
   * python3-wheel - so setup.py bdist will build
 .
 Note that most useful "tools" are not included because they are easier
 to pull straight from PyPI using pip/pipx/pip2bin.
 .
 Their documentation is also included as an optional recommendation.
