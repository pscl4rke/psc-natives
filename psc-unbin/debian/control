Description: Collection of binary-to-text converters
 This metapackage provides nothing itself, but depends on lots of packages
 that the maintainer uses to convert binary (often proprietary) file formats
 into plain text.  Useful for indexing tools, and for managing filesystems
 remotely over SSH.
 .
   * antiword - read MS .doc files
   * binutils - only for `strings` really
