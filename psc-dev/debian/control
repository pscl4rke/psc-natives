Description: Collection of tools for general software development
 This metapackage provides nothing itself, but depends on lots of packages
 that the maintainer uses for development.  They are:
 .
   * cloc - count lines of code
   * git - the version control system
   * make - the most common build tool
   * patch - to apply diffs
   * quilt - manage sets of patches to apply
   * ripgrep - quick searching using rg
   * shellcheck - to whinge about shell scripts
   * sqlite3 - a shell for databases
   * tig - to browse git history
   * vim - for editing files properly
 .
 Their documentation is also included, but only as a recommendation
 because some of them have non-free licensing.
