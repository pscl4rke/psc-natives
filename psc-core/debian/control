Description: Collection of pretty-much essential packages
 This package provides nothing itself, but depends on lots of packages
 that the maintainer considers close-to-essential.  That is:
 .
   * apt-offline - getting packages without a network
   * bash - the shell
   * coreutils - for everything else
   * curl - for getting stuff off the web
   * git - the version control system
   * less - because *everything* uses it
   * ncp - to npush/npoll across net (packaged myself)
   * openssh-client - to connect to servers
   * patch - to apply diffs
   * rsync - to pull data efficiently
   * vim - for editing files properly
   * wget - also for getting stuff
 .
 These are the bare minimum necessary to bootstrap a system.  Their
 documentation is also included.
 .
 Some of them might not seem completely necessary, but because
 other packages recommend them they'd be installed anyway.
