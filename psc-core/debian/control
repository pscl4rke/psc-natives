Description: Collection of pretty-much essential packages
 This package provides nothing itself, but depends on lots of packages
 that the maintainer considers close-to-essential.  That is:
 .
   * Git - the version control system
   * Bash - the shell
   * Vim - for editing files properly
   * Less - because *everything* uses it
   * Coreutils - for everything else
   * Apt-Offline - getting packages without a network
 .
 These are the bare minimum necessary to bootstrap a system.  Their
 documentation is also included.
