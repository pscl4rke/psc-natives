Description: Collection of libraries used by scripts
 This metapackage provides nothing itself, but depends on lots of
 packages for frequently-used libraries.  This is to enable scripts
 in places like ~/bin to just "import" a third-party library and
 work without additional installations.  Primarily Python libraries,
 but they don't have to be.
