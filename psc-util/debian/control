Description: Collection of well-used command line utilities
 This package provides nothing itself, but depends on lots of packages
 that the maintainer uses regularly on the command line.  They are:
 .
   * ed - the editor you only use when desparate
   * markdown - the text-to-html converter (pl version)
   * realpath - follow symlinks
   * sqlite3 - a shell for databases
 .
 Their documentation is also included.
