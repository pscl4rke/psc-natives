Description: Collection of well-used command line utilities
 This metapackage provides nothing itself, but depends on lots of packages
 that the maintainer uses regularly on the command line.  They are:
 .
   * adb - manage Android phones
   * ack-grep - ack is better than grep
   * acpi - monitor batteries and temperatures
   * apache2-utils - for htpasswd manager
   * apcalc - for the `calc` calculator
   * bc - for another calculator
   * bsdgames - for serious stuff, like rot13
   * bsdutils - for things like `logger`
   * bsdmainutils - esp. for `calendar` and `column`
   * colordiff - for more readable deltas
   * dc - for reverse polish calculations
   * dos2unix - the original crlf <-> lf converter
   * dnsutils - for `dig` and `nslookup`
   * ed - the editor you only use when desperate
   * fdupes - to find duplicates in a filesystem
   * figlet - create more big banners of text
   * file - tell file types with magic numbers
   * gettext-base - for `envsubst` templating
   * gpw - to generate codenames and vanity handles
   * hashdeep - formerly called md5deep
   * hledger - to balance the books
   * jq - for manipulating JSON
   * laptop-detect - guess type of computer
   * make - to build all sorts of things
   * markdown - the text-to-html converter (pl version)
   * moreutils - assorted stuff not in coreutils
   * mpc - connect to MPD servers
   * netcat-openbsd - the version with `nc -U`
   * oathtool - TOTP two-factor authentication
