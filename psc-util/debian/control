Description: Collection of well-used command line utilities
 This package provides nothing itself, but depends on lots of packages
 that the maintainer uses regularly on the command line.  They are:
 .
   * ack-grep - ack is better than grep
   * antiword - read MS .doc files
   * apache2-utils - for htpasswd manager
   * apcalc - for the `calc` calculator
   * bc - for another calculator
   * binutils - only for `strings` really
   * bsdgames - for serious stuff, like rot13
   * catdoc - also includes `catppt` and `xls2csv`
   * cloc - count lines of code
   * colordiff - for more readable deltas
   * dc - for reverse polish calculations
   * docx2txt - read MS .docx files
   * dos2unix - the original crlf <-> lf converter
   * ed - the editor you only use when desparate
   * fdupes - to find duplicates in a filesystem
   * file - tell file types with magic numbers
   * rlwrap - improve shell-like programs
   * gpw - to generate codenames and vanity handles
   * groff - a typesetter (more than just groff-base)
   * m4 - a text preprocessor
   * make - to build all sorts of things
   * markdown - the text-to-html converter (pl version)
   * moreutils - assorted stuff not in coreutils
   * msmtp - to send emails
   * offlineimap - synchronise with mail servers
   * pv - pipe viewer - cat with a progress bar
   * realpath - follow symlinks
   * sqlite3 - a shell for databases
   * sshuttle - for quick n dirty VPNs
   * strace - to see what a program is doing
   * telnet - for crude networking
   * tidy - to clean up HTML and XML files
   * tofrodos - another crlf <-> lf converter
   * tree - to visualise a filesystem
   * uuid - for random identifiers
 .
 Their documentation is also included.
